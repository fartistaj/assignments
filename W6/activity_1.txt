To detect queue overflow and underflow:

The ENQUEUE operation first checks if the queue is full before inserting an element; if full, it raises a queue overflow error. The DEQUEUE operation first checks if the queue is empty before removing an element; if empty, it raises a queue underflow error.

4. 

A deque (double-ended queue) allows insertion and deletion from both ends in O(1) time. The push_front operation inserts an element at the front by adjusting the Q.front index, while push_back inserts at the rear by updating Q.rear. Similarly, pop_front removes an element from the front and moves Q.front forward, while pop_back removes an element from the rear and moves Q.rear backward. If needed, the indices wrap around to maintain a circular structure. These operations ensure efficient and fast modifications at both ends of the deque.
